                <h2>welcome</h2>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is John and I'm excited to have you here.</p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <h4>When it comes to hobbies, I have a wide range of interests.</h4>
                <p>Of course, my passion lies in the field of information technology. I'm constantly keeping up with the
                    latest
                    trends and technologies, as it's an ever-evolving field. In addition to that, I also enjoy getting
                    together
                    with my friends for a friendly game of soccer at the park. It's a great way to stay active and have
                    fun.
                    When I'm not on the field or working on IT projects, you can often find me immersing myself in the
                    world
                    of video games. Whether it's exploring virtual realms or engaging in epic battles, gaming provides
                    me with
                    a thrilling escape. Lastly, I like to tap into my creative side by indulging in a bit of art.
                    Sketching and
                    painting allow me to express myself and find inner peace.</p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <h4>My journey in the world of IT began during my time at Cardale High School.</h4>
                <p>It was there that I discovered my fascination with information technology. The subject intrigued me
                    and I knew
                    I wanted to pursue a career in this field. I have a strong desire to continue learning and gaining
                    valuable
                    experience in IT. During my high school years, I had the opportunity to take some IT classes. These
                    classes
                    not only taught me the fundamentals but also provided me with the skills to build my very own
                    website.</p>
